<h2 id="class-features">Class Features</h2>
<p>As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.</p>
<h3 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h3>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d12 per barbarian level<br />
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 12 + your Constitution modifier<br />
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st  </p>
<h3 id="proficiencies">Proficiencies</h3>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields <br />
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons <br />
<strong>Tools:</strong> None <br />
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Constitution <br />
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival   </p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon</li>
<li>(a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon</li>
<li>An explorer's pack and four javelins</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rage">Rage</h3>
<hr />
<p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. <br />
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>
<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. <br />
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. <br />
Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. </p>
<h3 id="unarmored-defense">Unarmored Defense</h3>
<hr />
<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>
<h3 id="reckless-attack">Reckless Attack</h3>
<hr />
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. </p>
<h3 id="danger-sense">Danger Sense</h3>
<hr />
<p>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. 
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. </p>
<h3 id="primal-path">Primal Path</h3>
<hr />
<p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose a primal path to take, detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. </p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<hr />
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. </p>
<h3 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h3>
<hr />
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. </p>
<h3 id="fast-movement">Fast Movement</h3>
<hr />
<p>Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor. </p>
<h3 id="feral-instinct">Feral Instinct</h3>
<hr />
<p>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. <br />
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. </p>
<h3 id="brutal-critical">Brutal Critical</h3>
<hr />
<p>Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. 
This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. </p>
<h3 id="relentless-rage">Relentless Rage</h3>
<hr />
<p>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. <br />
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. </p>
<h3 id="persistent-rage">Persistent Rage</h3>
<hr />
<p>Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. </p>
<h3 id="indomitable-might">Indomitable Might</h3>
<hr />
<p>Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. </p>
<h3 id="primal-champion">Primal Champion</h3>
<hr />
<p>At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. </p>
<h1>Subclasses</h1>

<h2>Path of the Ancestral Guardian</h2>

<p>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.</p>
<p>Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</p>
<h3 id="ancestral-protectors">Ancestral Protectors</h3>
<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage of the target’s attacks.</p>
<h3 id="spirit-shield">Spirit Shield</h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.</p>
<p>When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.</p>
<h3 id="consult-the-spirits">Consult the Spirits</h3>
<p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the <a href="../../../spellcasting/spells/augury/">Augury</a> or <a href="../../../spellcasting/spells/clairvoyance/">Clairvoyance</a> spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of <a href="../../../spellcasting/spells/clairvoyance/">Clairvoyance</a> invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
<p>After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="vengeful-ancestors">Vengeful Ancestors</h3>
<p>At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Path of the Battlerager</h2>

<p>battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.</p>
<h3 id="restriction-dwarves-only">Restriction: Dwarves Only</h3>
<p>Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.</p>
<p>Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. </p>
<h3 id="battlerager-armor">Battlerager Armor</h3>
<p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use <a href="../../../adventuring/equipment/armor/">spiked armor</a> as a weapon.</p>
<p>While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.</p>
<h3 id="reckless-abandon">Reckless Abandon</h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.</p>
<h3 id="battlerager-charge">Battlerager Charge</h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.</p>
<h3 id="spiked-retribution">Spiked Retribution</h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 piercing damage if you are raging, aren't incapacitated, and are wearing spiked armor.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Path of the Beast</h2>

<p>Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.</p>
<p>Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can choose the origin of your feral might by discussing it with your DM.</p>
<h3 id="form-of-the-beast">Form of the Beast</h3>
<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal.</p>
<p>You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage:</p>
<p><strong>Bite.</strong> Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.</p>
<p><strong>Claws.</strong> Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.</p>
<p><strong>Tail.</strong> You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.</p>
<h3 id="bestial-soul">Bestial Soul</h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, the feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
<p>You can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish a short or long rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check’s total. You can make this special check only once per turn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infectious-fury">Infectious Fury</h3>
<p>At 10th level, when you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the beast within you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target takes 2d12 psychic damage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h3 id="call-the-hunt">Call the Hunt</h3>
<p>At 14th level, the beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends, the chosen creatures can use the following benefit once on each of their turns: when the creature hits a target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to the damage equal to the number rolled.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

<h2 id="path-of-the-berserker">Path of the Berserker</h2>
<p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end, that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. </p>
<h4 id="frenzy">Frenzy</h4>
<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in <a href="../../../rules/conditions/">Conditions</a>).</p>
<h4 id="mindless-rage">Mindless Rage</h4>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. </p>
<h4 id="intimidating-presence">Intimidating Presence</h4>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (<strong>DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</strong>) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.   <br />
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. </p>
<h4 id="retaliation">Retaliation</h4>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Path of the Storm Herald</h2>

<p>Typical barbarians harbor a fury that dwells within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn instead to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into nature to create powerful, magical effects.</p>
<p>Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect the natural realm. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges founded in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</p>
<h3 id="storm-aura">Storm Aura</h3>
<p>When you select this path at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.</p>
<p>Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>
<p>If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Desert.</strong> When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.</p>
<p><strong>Sea.</strong> When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.</p>
<p><strong>Tundra.</strong> When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.</p>
<h3 id="storm-soul">Storm Soul</h3>
<p>At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p>
<p><strong>Desert.</strong> You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.</p>
<p><strong>Sea.</strong> You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Tundra.</strong> You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.</p>
<h3 id="shielding-storm">Shielding Storm</h3>
<p>At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.</p>
<h3 id="raging-storm">Raging Storm</h3>
<p>At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p>
<p><strong>Desert.</strong> Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to your Barbarian level.</p>
<p><strong>Sea.</strong> When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.</p>
<p><strong>Tundra.</strong> Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Path of the Totem Warrior</h2>

<p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</p>
<p>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p>
<h3 id="spirit-seeker">Spirit Seeker</h3>
<p>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the Beast Sense and <a href="../../../spellcasting/spells/speak_with_animals/">Speak with Animals</a> spells, but only as rituals.</p>
<h3 id="totem-spirit">Totem Spirit</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p>
<p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p>
<p><strong>Bear.</strong> While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Eagle.</strong> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</p>
<p><strong>Elk.</strong> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.</p>
<p><strong>Tiger.</strong> While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf.</strong> While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p>
<h3 id="aspect-of-the-beast">Aspect of the Beast</h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p>
<p><strong>Bear.</strong> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.</p>
<p><strong>Eagle.</strong> You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Elk.</strong> Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.</p>
<p><strong>Tiger.</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf.</strong> You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.</p>
<h3 id="spirit-walker">Spirit Walker</h3>
<p>At 10th level, you can cast the <a href="../../../spellcasting/spells/commune_with_nature/">Commune with Nature</a> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.</p>
<h3 id="totemic-attunement">Totemic Attunement</h3>
<p>At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p>
<p><strong>Bear.</strong> While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.</p>
<p><strong>Eagle.</strong> While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p>
<p><strong>Elk.</strong> While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Tiger.</strong> While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf.</strong> While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.</p>
