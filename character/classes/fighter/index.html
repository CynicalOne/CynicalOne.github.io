<h3 id="action-surge">Action Surge</h3>

<h3 id="martial-archetype">Martial Archetype</h3>
<hr />
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description.

<hr />
<h1 id="subclasses">Subclasses</h1>
<p>Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach. </p>
<h2>Banneret</h2>

<p>A banneret is a knight who inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of one in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone banneret is a skilled warrior, but a banneret leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</p>
<p>A banneret prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a banneret spearheads an attack, their actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</p>
<h4 id="rallying-cry">Rallying Cry</h4>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.</p>
<p>When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.</p>
<h4 id="royal-envoy">Royal Envoy</h4>
<p>Knights of high standing are expected to conduct themselves with grace.</p>
<p>At 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance.</p>
<p>Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Persuasion. You receive this benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you gain from this feature.</p>
<h4 id="inspiring-surge">Inspiring Surge</h4>
<p>Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction, provided that it can see or hear you.</p>
<p>Starting at 18th level, you can choose two allies within 60 feet of you, rather than one.</p>
<h4 id="bulwark">Bulwark</h4>
<p>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Battle Master</h2>

<p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="combat-superiority">Combat Superiority</h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master:maneuvers">maneuvers</a> that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>
<p><strong>*Maneuvers.*</strong> You learn three <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master:maneuvers">maneuvers</a> of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>
<p><strong>*Superiority Dice.*</strong> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p>
<p><strong>*Saving Throws.*</strong> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p>
<h3 id="student-of-war">Student of War</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-enemy">Know Your Enemy</h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strength score</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dexterity score</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constitution score</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armor Class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current hit points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total class levels, if any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fighter class levels, if any</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improved-combat-superiority">Improved Combat Superiority</h3>
<p>At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.</p>
<h3 id="relentless">Relentless</h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.</p>
<hr />

<h2>Eldritch Knight</h2>

<p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p>

<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.</p>
<h6 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h6>
<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="../../../spellcasting/spell_lists/wizard_spells/">wizard spell list</a>. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
<h6 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h6>
<p>The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href="../../../spellcasting/spells/shield/">Shield</a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <a href="../../../spellcasting/spells/shield/">Shield</a> using either slot.</p>
<h6 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h6>
<p>You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the <a href="../../../spellcasting/spell_lists/wizard_spells/">wizard spell list</a>.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
<p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
<p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
<h6 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h6>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<h3 id="weapon-bond">Weapon Bond</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p>
<p>Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
<p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
<h3 id="war-magic">War Magic</h3>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>
<h3 id="eldritch-strike">Eldritch Strike</h3>
<p>At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>
<h3 id="arcane-charge">Arcane Charge</h3>
<p>At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.</p>
<h3 id="improved-war-magic">Improved War Magic</h3>
<p>Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Rune Knight</h2>

<p>Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-proficiencies">Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith’s tools, and you learn to speak, read, and write Giant.</p>
<h3 id="rune-carver">Rune Carver</h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.</p>

</table></div>
<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.</p>
<p>The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Rune.</li>
</ul>
<p>This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire Rune.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frost Rune.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stone Rune.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="giant-might">Giant Might</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h3 id="runic-shield">Runic Shield</h3>
<p>At 7th level, you learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h3 id="great-stature">Great Stature</h3>
<p>By 10th level, the magic of your runes permanently alters you. When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll.</p>
<p>Moreover, the extra damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to 1d8.</p>
<h3 id="master-of-runes">Master of Runes</h3>
<p>At 15th level, you can invoke each rune you know from your Rune Carver feature twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="runic-juggernaut">Runic Juggernaut</h3>
<p>At 18th level, you learn how to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a result, the extra damage you deal with the Giant's Might feature increases to 1d10. Moreover, when you use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you are that size, your reach increases by 5 feet.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Samurai
</h2>

<p>The Samurai is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to overcome enemies. A samurai’s resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the enemies in a samurai’s path have two choices: yield or die fighting.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-proficiency">Bonus Proficiency</h3>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="fighting-spirit">Fighting Spirit</h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on all weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.</p>
<p>You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h3 id="elegant-courtier">Elegant Courtier</h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).</p>
<h3 id="tireless-spirit">Tireless Spirit</h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-strike">Rapid Strike</h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an attack roll against against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.</p>
<h3 id="strength-before-death">Strength Before Death</h3>
<p>Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
