                        <h1 id="the-planes-of-existence">The Planes of Existence</h1>
<p>The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the <strong>planes of existence</strong>. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.  <br />
Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn. </p>
<h2 id="the-material-plane">The Material Plane</h2>
<p>The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.  <br />
The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned. </p>
<h3>First Material Plane</h3>

<p>A small world built to house the first form of life. They were created to be perfect beings that would worship and revere the gods for the gifts they were given. Unfortunately for the gods, the creatures were too great. The creatures were wise enough to not need the guidance of the gods, strong enough to fend for themselves (even against natural disasters), stubborn enough to resent gods who tried to manipulate them, long lived enough to be patient, and intelligent enough to be totally self sufficient. The gods were not needed, and felt abandoned by their own creations. The gods grew frustrated with these creatures. This was not the life creating experience the gods were hoping for, so they abandoned the world and moved on. The creatures barely noticed and continued quite happily. Those living in the prime material plane now know these creatures as dragons.</p>
<h3>Second Material Plane</h3>

<p>The second time around, the gods created creatures not to be perfect, but to be imperfect; to need the gods in their daily life and to be open to changing their minds on who to worship. These creatures of weak will and great desire proved nightmarish and chaotic. They switched gods too quickly and were almost entirely dependent upon the gods for survival. In the end, the gods got tired of micromanaging these lowly, pathetic creatures and abandoned their world, leaving them all to die. However, these creatures didn't die. Over the millennia, they've twisted themselves into beings of hate and spite. They've changed their physical form and unlocked the secrets of the universe through powerful magics. They are what the creatures of the prime material plane know as demons.</p>
<h3>Third Material Plane (Prime Material Plane)</h3>

<pre><code>
</code></pre>
<p>Taking the lessons of their former worlds to heart, the gods created a messy world with creatures of great and lesser strengths, people who were swayed easily and those who were not swayed at all, gave them tools to be independent, but set them against each other so that they would always have need of guidance and strength from the gods. This is the world our stories take place in.</p>
<h3 id="planar-travel">Planar Travel</h3>
<p>When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.  <br />
Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.  <br />
<strong>Spells.</strong> A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. <strong><em>Plane shift</em></strong> and <strong><em>gate</em></strong> can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. <strong><em>Etherealness</em></strong> allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches--such as the Elemental Planes. And the <strong><em>astral projection</em></strong> spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.  <br />
<strong>Portals.</strong> A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water). </p>
<h2 id="elemental-planes">Elemental Planes</h2>
<p>Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.  One such grouping being the Elemental planes. Each of the four elements is a quadrant of a great sphere. The point in which all four elements meet is a staff that supports and spins the world. The stones that fall off of this staff and land in the Prime Material Plane are known as Philosopher's Stones.</p>
<h3>Plane of Earth</h3>

<p>A mass of earth and stone, solid all the way through. Networks of rock travel like veins through the plane. Using a spell that turns one into stone would permit a traveler from the Prime Material Plane to walk through the plane of earth. This plane acts as the center of gravity for all other planes. Those in the water or fire planes are automatically oriented with an up/down in relation to air/earth. Xorns, worms, and other normal looking forms of life inhabit this place.</p>
<h3> Plane of Water</h3>

<p>A vast ocean lit from the Celestial Plane. The light comes in from the outer side. In the opposite direction of the light is the shadow plane, then the Prime Material Plane. Up is towards the plane of air, down is towards the plane of earth. Great pillars of salt traverse the otherwise sweet water, creating zones of saline water that are deadly to some forms of life on this plane. Slimes that feed on the salt pillars create briney blobs that grow ever larger as they devour each other. When they die, they sink towards the elemental plane of earth where they are eventually taken back up into the salt pillars.</p>
<h3>Plane of Fire</h3>

<p>A writhing mass of fire and light. There is no air to breathe and temperatures are hot enough to ignite any combustible materials. While there is no life native to the elemental plane of fire, occasionally an air elemental will get trapped within the fire plane and shift from air spirit to fire spirit. These elementals are appropriately hot tempered and fast acting. They are difficult, if not impossible, to control. Knowing how difficult it is to survive in the plane of fire, a few creatures of exceptional power have made homes here.</p>
<h3> Plane of Air</h3>

<p>A vast empty space lit from two sides. The outer side provides dim light in comparison to the brightly lit border of the Fire plane that is blindingly bright. Since the plane of air opposes that of the plane of earth, there is no set down direction. A creature in the plane of air simply decides which way is down and falls in that direction until they change their perspective or run into the plane of water/fire (probably at high speeds, killing them). Clouds absorb water near the plane of water and grow agitated near the plane of fire. This proto-life form stores energy until it can hold no more, and lets it out in large bolts of lightning. Where they strike the fog, new clouds form, grow, and shift about.</p>

<h2>The Borders of the Elemental Planes</h2>

<h4>Earth/Water</h4>

<p>Bordering the planes of earth and water are the remains of all life that has died in the elemental plane of water. Most of this material is a soft silt, creating a semi-liquid viscous material that slowly becomes more dense until you arrive at the plane of earth.</p>
<h4>Earth/Fire</h4>

<p>Where the plane of fire meets the plane of earth is a blackened and charred wasteland of hot rock. Occasionally the plane of earth will quake, opening small fissures that reach out to the plane of fire. This intense heat, mixed with the pressures of the earth plane closing back in create various pockets of raw gems which make their way to the PMP by traveling earth elementals who leave them in their wake. Mountains of rock burst across the divide creating a hellscape. Shards of obsidian the size of mountains force their way from the stone. These landscapes crumble as quickly as they form.</p>
<h4>Air/Water</h4>

<p>The border between these two planes is the surface of an ocean blanketed with dense fog. As you move into the plane of air, the fog thins into transparent air. Air bubbles spontaneously form under the surface of the water giving this ocean a carbonated look.</p>
<h4>Air/Fire</h4>

<p>Raging firestorms make the border between two planes more fluid than all the rest. Hot gases rush in all directions and spontaneous gouts of fire belch into the plane of air, while cool breezes and pockets of tranquility occasionally find their way into the plane of fire.</p>
<h2>Non-Elemental Planes</h2>

<h3>Shadow Plane</h3>

<p>Always dimly lit and leached of all color. Light sources do not produce light, although they may produce heat if they normally do. For example, a torch will burn hot enough that you don't want to touch it, but it will shed no light. The flames will be visible as dancing bits of gray. There is a shadow plane of each of the material planes, taking on the form of the material plane in the same way a footprint is the form of a foot. It is a shadow of the world. Life in the shadow plane is almost non-existent.</p>
<h3>Celestial Plane</h3>

<p>All the gods, except Felumbra, have fixed positions in the sky. Felumbra takes the form of the moon, and cruises around the world. This plane is inaccessible to creatures from the Prime Material Plane. Comets mark the movement occurring between the Celestial Plane and the Prime Material Plane. Any god coming into the Prime Material Plane would be visible for a period of days to everybody on the Prime Material Plane and all the gods. This means that gods cannot sneak into the Prime Material Plane</p>
<h3>Ethereal Plane</h3>

<p>The Ethereal Plane is the space between the material world and the spirit world. It has the shape of the material world without living or dead matter. Existence in this plane is a combination of both borders. To imagine the ethereal plane, think of a snapshot of the material world, then remove all gasses, living matter, and dead matter. What remains is projected like a 3 dimensional, slightly out of focus, silhouette. These projections are the boundaries of the ethereal plane, and while they are immutable, their surfaces and edges are hazy to a depth of 2". The space of the ethereal plane is a dimly illuminated misty vapor known as ether. When creatures exist in the ethereal plane, their surface manifests as condensation in the ether, but they maintain a gaseous quality.</p>
<p>As the material world changes, so does the ethereal. Should a creature run into a projection, either by moving to the projection or the projection moving to the creature, the creature will typically flow harmlessly along the edge of the projection, like a gas against a solid. This makes ethereal creatures immune to attacks from the material world. There are some exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p>Items made from mithril, or those enchanted to exist in the ethereal plane have non-hazy projections that can affect ethereal creatures. Lead has a solid, non-hazy, edge, but is inert. Silver is much the same as lead, but rather than be inert is reflective.</p>
<p>Magical energy disrupts the ether much the same as it disrupts the material world.</p>
<p>The material plane is energy positive, the spirit plane(Felumbra/The moon) is energy negative, and the ethereal plane is energy neutral. Any bridge to the ethereal plane will create an energy flow in one direction: Material &gt; ethereal &gt; spirit. In the material world this usually takes the form of a cold spot, although should the bridge be mobile its movement may cause flickering flames, rustling leaves or papers, etc. Ethereal creatures projecting into the material world are sensitive to the high energies of the material plane. Sunlight is so bright as to be blinding and direct light can cause damage and searing pain to ethereal creatures.</p>
<h4 id="demiplanes">Demiplanes</h4>
<p>Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as <strong><em>demiplane</em></strong>, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a <strong><em>plane shift</em></strong> spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The <strong><em>gate</em></strong> spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p>
